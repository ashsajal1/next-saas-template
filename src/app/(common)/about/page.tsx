          This website is a collection of small and simple tools that I find
          useful. It&apos;s a place where I can share my ideas, prototypes, and
          experiments.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The tools on this site are built using modern web technologies and
          designed to be easy to use and understand. Each tool is documented
          with examples and explanations to help you get started.
